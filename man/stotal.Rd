\usage{
stotal(x, ...)

\method{stotal}{default}(
  x,
  na.rm = T,
  var_type = "none",
  level = 0.95,
  use_df = T,
  ids,
  sv,
  st,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{vector. Vector of values to compute a weighted total over}

\item{...}{other arguments. Currently unused.}

\item{na.rm}{logical. Determines whether NAs are removed from calculations}

\item{var_type}{character. Report variability as one or more of: standard error ("se", default) and confidence interval ("ci")}

\item{level}{numeric. A value in the range of (0, 1) denoting what level of confidence the CI should be}

\item{use_df}{logical. Should the estimated degrees of freedom by used to calculate CIs? Default is FALSE (different from \code{smean}. FALSE implies df = Inf.}

\item{ids}{numeric. indices which are being computed. Can be generally omitted and will be added to the call via `[.dtsurvey`}

\item{sv}{data.table. Data.table of psu, strata, weight and the like to properly do survey statistics.}

\item{st}{character. type of survey dataset being analyzed. Can be generally omitted and will be added to the call via `[.dtsurvey`}
}
\value{
a vector or a list (the latter likely converted into a data.table) containing the results
}
\description{
Calculate the survey total
}
\details{
If var_type is "none", a vector is returned. For factors, the names of the vector correspond to the levels. It should also be ordered in that way
         In that case a list/data.table is returned with a column for the result and a column specifying the levels. When var_type is not "none" a named list is returned (and then likely converted into a data.table).
         The list (which should be named) is ordered in the following manner (by slot): result, se, lower, upper, levels -- when requested.
