# dtsurvey

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

dtsurvey is a partial implementation of `survey` package routines so that `data.table` syntax can be used. Basic aggregations like means and totals are implemented for both classic complex survey designs and replicate designs. Fancier things like regressions, finite population corrections (FPCs) and what not are not implemented.

## Installation

From [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jason-thompson/dtsurvey")
```
## Example

Before survey calculations can be computed, a dataset must be declared as a type of `dtsurvey` object:

```{r example}
library(dtsurvey, quietly = TRUE)
library('survey', quietly = TRUE) # to get access to the datasets
data(api)

#survey vs. dtsurvey style, complex surveys
dclus1<-svydesign(id=~dnum, weights=~pw, data=apiclus1)
dtclus1 <- dtsurvey(apiclus1, 'dnum', weight = 'pw')

#dtsurvey loosely wraps survey::svrepdesign for replicate designs
# You can either pass the arguments for svrepdesign through ..., or pass
# an existing svrepdesign
drep = as.svrepdesign(dclus1)
dtrep1 = dtrepsurvey(drep)

#To get access to dtsurvey routines, but with non survey data, use `dtadmin`
dtad = dtadmin(apiclus1)

```

Compute means/proportions with `smean` within a `[`

```{r means}

##means
#Standard complex survey
dtclus1[, smean(api00), by = stype] #grouping commands are easy
dtclus1[stype == 'E', smean(api00), by = both] #so is subsetting!
dtclus1[, smean(api00, var_type = c('se', 'ci'))] #adding error metrics

#Replicate survey
dtrep1[, smean(api00), by = stype] #grouping commands are easy
dtrep1[stype == 'E', smean(api00), by = both] #so is subsetting!
dtrep1[, smean(api00, var_type = c('se', 'ci'))] #adding error metrics

#Normal dataset. smean should be equal to `mean`
dtad[, smean(api00), by = stype] #grouping commands are easy
dtad[stype == 'E', smean(api00), by = both] #so is subsetting!
dtad[, smean(api00, var_type = c('se', 'ci'))] #adding error metrics


```

Basic column assignment is still possible after an object is case as a dtsurvey/dtrepsurvey/dtadmin. While it is possible to assign the results of `smean` (and `stotal`) using the `:=` approach, that should be used sparingly. Factors and instances where `var_type != NULL` return weird objects. Worth testing out before going too crazy.

```{r assign}
dtclus1[, count := 1] # to estimate the total number of schools
dtrep1[, count := 1]

```

Compute totals with `stotal`

```{r totals}

dtclus1[, stotal(count), by = stype]
dtrep1[, stotal(count), by = stype]

```

Factors work within `smean` and `stotal`, but can be weird:
```{r factors}
class(dtclus1[, awards])

#How to identify which value belongs to what
dtclus1[, smean(awards)] #returns a named vector

a = dtclus1[, smean(awards),stype] #also returns a named vector, but stripped
a
names(a[, V1]) #ruhroh

#however, with some clever ordering, you should be able to recover the levels
dtclus1[, fff := factor(sample(c('A', 'B'), nrow(dtclus1), replace = T))]
dtclus1[stype == 'E', fff := 'A']
dtclus1[, .(smean(fff), levels(fff)), stype]

#NAs in the factor seem to work alright
dtclus1[stype == 'M' & fff == 'A', fff := NA]
dtclus1[, .(smean(fff), levels(fff)), stype]


#factors with ses and cis
#because multiple columns are being returned, a "levels" column comes along
# for the ride
dtclus1[, smean(fff, var_type = c('se', 'ci')), stype]

```

When a CI is needed for proportions, additional methods of for calculating CIs are available

```{r props}

#default borrowed from survey package (and general statistics)
dtclus1[, smean(awards, var_type = 'ci', ci_method = 'mean')]

#See survey::svyciprop for more info about how these work
dtclus1[, smean(awards, var_type = 'ci', ci_method = 'xlogit')] #xlogit
dtclus1[, smean(awards, var_type = 'ci', ci_method = 'beta')] #beta

#dtadmin have their own method
dtad[, smean(awards, var_type = 'ci', ci_method = 'unweighted_binary'), stype]

#vary the level
dtclus1[, smean(awards, var_type = 'ci', ci_method = 'xlogit', level = .9)]
dtclus1[, smean(awards, var_type = 'ci', ci_method = 'xlogit', level = .99)]

```
